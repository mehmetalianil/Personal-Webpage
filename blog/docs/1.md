#First Post

This will be my blog for my musings and this entry is for test purposes. The webpage uses StripDown in order to render the markdown scripts, and MathJAX for rendering tex equations. The objective was to have a very simple and static page to put my thoughts into words in web log fashion. 

Here is an equation: 

$$ F^{/mu /nu} = /delta^{/mu} A^{/nu} - /delta^{/nu} A^{/mu} $$

which, as you can see is an antisymmetric rank 2 tensor.
